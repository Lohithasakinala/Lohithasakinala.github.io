I have done my internship in <u><span style = "color:orange">NIT Warangal</span></u>. Well, there were around 70 students who had come from different colleges. They are from CSE and ECE branches. And we all worked under the guidance of <u><span style = "color:orange">Dr. Anjaneyulu sir</span></u>. It was really a great experience working under his guidance. Quizzes are also conducted on these topics. 
 		Along with these, we also learnt HTML and created some simple web pages. <br> <br>
